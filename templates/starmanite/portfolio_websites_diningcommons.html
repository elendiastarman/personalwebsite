		<p>I did the tutorial for Django in a weekend and then almost immediately set about working on a full-fledged website. Following tips from
		one of my supervisors at my Dining Commons job, I designed and developed an employee scheduling website that was intended to replace their
		current one. As it happened, that plan fell through because, unbeknowest to me, Dining Services (the organization that encompassed Dining
		Commons) was already in negotiations with another company and was planning on installing their product. Nonetheless, my Django skills and
		my general web development skills improved greatly over the three months that I worked on the website.</p>
		
		<p>The site can be viewed here: <a href="http://dctest.elendia.webfactional.com/">Dining Commons Demo</a>. <em>Note: website-breaking bugs
		abound because I'm not quite done setting it up fully. You have been warned.</em></p>
		
		<p>These usernames and passwords can be used to explore the site's functionality (in the form "<em>username</em>": "<em>password</em>"):
		<ul>
			<li>testsupervisor: testsupervisor</li>
			<li>testmanager: testmanager</li>
			<li>testworker: testworker</li>
		</ul>
