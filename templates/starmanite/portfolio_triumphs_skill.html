		<p><strong>Standardized Tests</strong> &mdash; On the SAT, I achieved a score of 2100, out of 2400 possible, 
		and on the ACT I achieved a score of 35, out of 36 possible. A 35 on the ACT is roughly equivalent to a 2340 
		on the SAT and both are very high scores.</p>
		
		<p><strong>North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics</strong> &mdash; NCSSM is literally one of the best 
		high schools in the nation. Newsweek considers it "too elite to rank" on its annual list of best high schools. I 
		was one of about 340 applicants that were accepted out of a pool of about 2,500 my year.</p>

		<p><strong>Tae Kwon Do</strong> &mdash; I started doing Tae Kwon Do shortly after my 8th birthday in 2000. Not long after my 15th birthday in 
		2007, I received my 3rd degree black belt. I continued going to classes regularly until around 2009-2010, which means I did Tae Kwon Do for about 
		10 years. I went to competitions two or three times, competing in Forms in all of them. I earned one bronze medal for that.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Capoeira</strong> &mdash; I started doing capoeira when I came to RIT in the fall of 2011. Since then, I have developed a decent level 
		of skill. I have not yet earned a green cord, but I hope to do so soon.</p>

		<p><strong>Challenge 24</strong> &mdash; In 2004, I reached the semi-finals in a Challenge 24 competition. Challenge 24 is a fast-paced mental math 
		game where the objective is to add, subtract, multiply, or divide four numbers to get 24. This must be done before three other players do the same, 
		and the steps to the solution must be given within 15 seconds from touching the card.</p>
