		<h2>Lumien and the Seven Relics</h2>
		
		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Prologue &ndash; Story Time!</strong></p>
		
		<p>Dusk found an old hedgehog dozing in a recliner. His fur had a golden hue all around, except for a purple splotch that started at the sides of his eyes and extended upwards to encompass nearly his entire forehead. At the top it converged at the base of his first head spine, which jutted out from the front of the top of his head at about a 30 degree angle away from vertical. The fur on his primary spine was purple, the rest &ndash; six spines that formed an upside down "V" with the primary one down his back &ndash; were golden like his body fur. The recliner had fine, brown, leather; synthetic of course. The creature's head was tilted to the left, glasses hanging slightly askew. He had a book in his lap, his right hand keeping the book open. Every few seconds, his chest rose and fell, accompanied by a quiet snore. In front of him was glass wall with a door in the middle of it, facing the setting sun. The side walls were taken up by large bookcases crammed with books of every size and color. Behind him was the door that lead to the rest of the house. Slowly, a crack appeared and widened. The pusher came into view, a much younger hedgehog. The little one's fur was a mesh between the other's fur color and a fiery orange. He peeked in, being cautious not to make a sound. Seeing that the old guy was apparently asleep, the little tyke grinned mischievously. He turned and motioned with his hand, beckoning two other children into the room. Unlike the first one, the other two appeared to be products of cross-species breeding. One had mottled green fur with traces of sky blue and black while the other had a curious blend of leafy green and a deep oceanic blue. The former seemed to be a cross between a fox and a bat, having wings as well as two tails; the wings were currently folded against her back. The latter also seemed to be a cross species, this time having a broad, flat tail, oversized knuckles, and spines like stalactites. She whispered something to the leader, causing him to look at her incredulously. After a moment, he shook his head and whispered back, then started for the middle of the room. As the girls got into position, the mastermind crept up in front and started sneaking the book out from the old one's paws. As soon as the book was completely out of the hedgehog's lap, his eyes snapped open. The thief immediately took off, running back towards the interior of the house. Realizing what happened, the other one scrambled out of the easy chair and zoomed after the perpetrator, only to trip over a rope the two accomplices had set out. He glared at the girls who had been thrown forward, annoyed at their interference but relieved that they had not been hurt. He quickly got back to his feet and dashed after the youngling. The youngster led the elder on a merry chase all throughout the house. Eventually though, a trap was cleverly set by the wise and sprung by the naive. Before the prankster could turn around, the senior scooped him up in his arms and snatched the book out of his grasp. Setting it down safely, he started to torture the little one with tickles. At once, the juvenile relented and begged to be put down.</p>
		<p>The older one chuckled and said, "Now why would I put you down, my son...the wanna-be thief?"</p>
		<p>Squirming, the son squealed, "Yaaa! Put me down! All I wanted was a story!"</p>
		<p>Stroking his nonexistent goatee, the father replied. "Paedlum, I'll tell you what: how about you go get the others and bring them all to the library. You want a story? I'll tell you a story that'll knock your socks off! Hows that?"</p>
		<p>"Sure thing Dad!"</p>
		<p>A boy on a mission, Paedlum had soon gathered up the other residents of the house. All together, they were quite an eclectic bunch, consisting of yet another hedgehog, a fox, an echinda, a bat, a beaver, and a robot. One of them asked, "What do you have in mind, Lumien?"</p>
		<p>He replied, "Sit down, and I'll tell you a grand tale." Heeding his instruction, the newcomers and the children sat down in a semicircle facing Lumien. "Well," he began, "I didn't always look like this. In fact, my appearance changed drastically many years ago. But that is getting ahead of myself. Come closer and listen to this yarn, the adventure of my youth."</p>
