			<li><p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0;">The model under consideration is that concepts in a person's mind have labels attached to them and that these concepts are linked in a web of relationships.<br/><br/><br/></p></li>
			<li><p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0;">If a concept is known but a label is missing, then the person who wants to communicate that concept to others must do so by way of related concepts.<br/><br/><br/></p></li>
			<li><p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0;">Concept-labels in the “middle” that are connected to many others are more difficult to alter as doing so would require altering the associ-ations between it and other concept-labels, and would also require some adjustment of related concept-labels.</p></li>
