	<p>I had never undertaken a project of this scale before (unless <a href="{% url 'index:sigprogs' %}#mappingschool">Mapping the School</a> counts) so, instead of starting the code right away, I spent a lot of time thinking about it. I wanted to have a sufficiently complex engine that could run a very wide variety of chess-like games, but I also wanted to be sure that it wouldn't be too complex. I wrote down some code on a whiteboard and also drew a dependence tree to prioritize the functions and features that I needed to do first.</p>

	<p>At the time of writing, the only features left to implement to have a fully functioning chess engine are promotion, check, and checkmate.</p>
	
	<p>As to the underlying design of the engine, Blitz 2D does not have local multidimensional arrays (multidimensional arrays are global and local arrays are one-dimensional), so I had to be a bit creative. The cells that make up the board form a 2D linked array, and they also have pointers to the pieces on them. The pieces themselves have moves associated with them. Such is the underlying structure of the engine, and all of the functions and features are built on this structure.</p>

	<p><strong>External customizability</strong> is one feature that I had in my code from the beginning. What I mean by that is that very little 
	is hard-coded, so the engine gets most of its information from a text file that is read in and parsed. The <em>import</em> function is a huge 
	chunk of the code as there isn't a built-in function that operates like Python's <em>split</em>, so I had to parse it myself with functions 
	that Blitz 2D did provide, specifically <em>Instr</em> and <em>Mid</em>, which returned the position of a character and a specified substring, 
	respectively. The external text file provides information such as the positions of cells, their neighbors, their pieces, and their moves.</p>
	
	<p><strong>Linked lists</strong> abound in my code. Blitz 2D does not support lists of objects, but thankfully it does support linking 
	from one object to another. Hence, in several places, I use doubly-linked lists and I wrote functions to make it easier to add, get, and 
	remove objects from those linked lists.</p>
	
	<p><strong>Bug-free</strong> is a quality I like in my programs. Before I add a new feature, I make sure that my code is bug-free by tracking 
	down and fixing bugs. I have been known to stay awake well into the wee hours of the morning just to fix one bug. Once my code is bug-free, 
	then I increment the version number and save (thus employing a rudimentary version of <strong>source control</strong>). That way, any later 
	bugs I encounter are almost certainly a result of the new code I added, which makes it easier to locate and eliminate them. I have known and 
	understood almost since I started programming that bugs are far easier to get rid of if they are taken care of as soon as possible and not 
	later, when the code has grown in size and complexity.</p>
