	<h2>A Concept-Web Model of Language</h2>
	
	<div id="noSlides" class="show">
		<p>In this paper on the subject of language, I advance an abstract conceptual model of language to explain many significant features of human languages and communication forms. This model holds that concepts are related to each other in a web and that concepts have labels attached to them. The aim of this paper is to show that this model suffices to explain certain features of human language, such as translation and the difference between prose and poetry. There is a great deal of similarity between this model and Saussure's semiotics, but there are a couple major differences. Certain aspects of this model are also similar to W.V.O Quine and Gadamer's works.</p>
		<p>The model under consideration is that concepts in a person's mind have labels attached to them and that these concepts are linked in a web of relationships. A concept is generally an idea or collection of ideas. A label could be a spoken word, written word, sign, or even an image. Relationships between concepts don't have to be just between synonyms or related words, such as yellow and gold, although those sorts of relationships certainly would constitute a great portion of the relational web. Links can also be due to associations made in a person's past, like associating great heights with fear or the color red with blood. Concepts can have multiple labels, and multiple concepts can be labeled with the same word. For instance, “happy”, “glad”, and “exuberant” all describe varying degrees of joy, and “run” is a label for multiple concepts, as evidenced by the different meanings in the following phrases: “run a race”, “run for President”, and “my nose is running”. Concepts are linked with labels, and so-called concept-label pairs are linked with each other to form the concept-label web. The concepts, labels, and concept-label pairs of this model correspond with the signified, signifiers, and signs in semiotics, respectively, but one major difference is that “label” here is more general. The other major difference is that semiotics doesn't deal with a network of signs in the way this model does.</p>
		<p>Now, it is possible to be missing labels, concepts, or both. If a concept is known but a label is missing, then the person who wants to communicate that concept to others must do so by way of related concepts. For instance, they might describe a situation where they were totally absorbed in their work, had no problem focusing on it, and even enjoyed it. This is one way to describe the mental state that is often called “flow”. On the other hand, a person might have a label but not the concept. In this case, confusion is a common result. The average layperson likely doesn't know what solipsism is, and an attempt to ask them what it was would only result in a confession of ignorance if they're being honest. In such a case, the label “solipsism” exists, but there is no concept to attach that label to until it has been learned and understood. This case of a label without a concept also applies to made-up words. Confusion and misunderstanding can easily result from the lack of particular concepts or labels.</p>
		<p>It is also possible to lack relational links between certain concepts, or to have them between concepts where most people wouldn't have them. For instance, a mathematician would attach special significance to March 14th as that's “Pi Day”, which is one situation where a relational link exists for a relatively small number of people. On the other hand, a situation where a relational link that's usually there but isn't would include cases where mentioning Mario or Sonic conjures up images of newer games rather than the old, original games. Another such situation might be the fact that braiding strands is related to the concept of symmetric groups in mathematics. It's worth noting that older people would generally have more relational links between concepts than younger people merely because they've had more time and experiences to make those links.</p>
		<p>When new objects or ideas are encountered, they are incorporated into the concept-label web. For this model, it doesn't matter whether an object is physical and tangible, it still gets its own concept-label in the web. As a new concept-label is added, new relational links to other concept-labels will also be added to connect it to the rest of the web. First impressions are a great example of this. The first time someone sees another person, perhaps a homeless person, a new concept-label is added to their concept-label web for that person. That concept-label would then get associated with other concept-labels depending on what they're wearing, how they speak, and so forth, like “poor” and “uncouth”. These associated concept-labels were probably already associated with other concept-labels like “stinky” and “unreliable”. As a result, the homeless person would probably be immediately labeled as someone to avoid, all within the first few seconds. On the other hand, a person that's dedicated to helping the homeless might instead label the same person as someone in need and someone they can and want to help. As this example shows, the webs formed by these concepts, labels, and links between them are heavily influenced by experience. Consequently, these webs will vary from person to person, sometimes widely.</p>
		<p>With this model of concept-label webs, translation then largely becomes a matter of converting between labels. As many, if not most, labels refer to multiple concepts, knowing which one to choose usually requires context, which is why translation is almost never perfectly real-time. Plus, in one language, a concept-label may have certain associations that aren't present in the other language, so translation has to take this into account as well to help the listener or reader understand the intent and connotations of the original words. Culture and history plays a large role in this too, mainly with regards to the relational links between concepts and labels. The philosopher Gadamer expressed a similar view of translation in his Truth and Method: “Language as the Medium of Hermeneutical Experience”. One important point he makes is that every translation is also an interpretation (p 346). The field of hermeneutics exists largely for this reason: the best translation is almost never a transliteration. Every translation is an interpretation mainly because the translator must first map the speaker's words and meanings onto their own concept-label web, and then express it using a different concept-label web to the listener. Hence, in a sense, the translator is actually translating in three steps – from the speaker to themselves, between the languages within themselves, and then from themselves to the listener. Indeed, a sort of translation can occur between two people using the same language, and in fact happens all of the time.</p>
		<p>Even within one language, two different people will almost certainly have differing concept-label pairs. Ask any two people what their definitions of “good” or “truth” are, and they'll probably tell you different things. Or in another case, the meaning of “fast runner” would be different between the ordinary layperson who rarely runs and Olympic runners. In addition, different people will have different relational links between concept-label pairs. One person might associate a sword with slaughter, blood-shedding, murder, war, and the like, whereas another person might instead associate a sword with hard work, tactics, exercise, nobility, honor, and other knightly concepts. Or, as another example, one person might associate “nuclear power” with the disasters of Chernobyl and Fukushima whereas another might instead see it as a very good and much safer alternative to coal power. The issues of imprecise correlations between concept-label pairs and the differences in associations between certain concept-label pairs likely contribute to a great deal of the impreciseness of communication. It very well may be the case that most confusions and misinterpretations stem largely from the mismatches, minor and major, between the concept-label pairs of different people.</p>
		<p>Nuance is also a significant feature. Some people might wonder how “to tell”, “to say”, and “to speak” are different and if so, why it matters. On the other hand, others might see the differences as crucial and the choice between them very important. Continuing with the model of the concept-label web, the first group of people would have one concept with three labels whereas the second group would have three concepts with one label each that are nonetheless very closely related. This tends to be a matter of precision – coal and charcoal are pretty similar, but they are formed in different ways and coal burns better and for longer than charcoal. As another example, there is a technical difference between freezing rain and sleet, which is that the former is rain that freezes on the ground and the latter is rain that freezes in the air, but someone who doesn't know about the difference would see them as much the same thing. In general, more vocabulary means that many broad concept-labels can be and have been split into more-nuanced, but related, concept-pairs.</p>
		<p>That's not to say that there is no common ground, though. For most concept-labels, people of a particular language will have similar understandings. For instance, excepting blind and color-blind people, most English-speaking people would say that stop signs, tomatoes, and blood are all red. Most people would agree that someone buying dinner for a homeless person is doing a good deed. Most would agree that one plus one is two. For communication to be effective, it must utilize the common ground between two people's concept-label webs. A Christian, a Muslim, and an atheist must have some sort of common ground for definitions of God, good, evil, religion, faith, and the like for any meaningful discussion to take place on the matter of religion. Talking past one another is an example of a failure to recognize and communicate through the common ground. Another way that the common ground is utilized is to provide a place to build from. For instance, a child is taught that one plus one equals two before they are taught how to add five and seven, and they are taught how to add before they are taught how to multiply. Education is all about building on prior knowledge &ndash; and correcting it in some cases &ndash; in order to expand the student's concept web. The distinction between Kantian and Utilitarian ethics would likely be lost on someone who hadn't had a background discussion about whether a non-action that allows a greater evil to happen would be morally good, bad, or okay.</p>
		<p>Poetry and prose use this common ground in different ways. Prose seems to be more along the lines of specifying the concepts and the links between them. One could say that they got into bed and pulled the covers over themselves. Here is a specific sequence of actions, a specific set of subjects, verbs, and objects. A specific path through the concept-label web is expressed. Poetry, on the other hand, seems to be more geared towards a sort of cloud of paths through an individual's concept-label web. The person mentioned before could also have said that they fell into the bed's embrace, cocooning themselves inside the covers. Here, the focus is more on the associations. An average English speaker would likely know what a cocoon is, and thus this would bring to mind the idea of being tightly but comfortably wrapped in the bed covers. This may also evoke feelings of warmth, comfort, homeliness, and so forth. The concept-label of “cocoon” has a specific meaning, but the intended meanings are conveyed by the other concept-labels that “cocoon” is relationally linked to. Poetry seems to be more about pointing out certain concept-labels and letting an individual's concept-label web influence the meanings derived and emotions felt from the path taken between the concept-labels. Hence, prose is better for clarity and directness of meaning, but poetry is better for evoking emotions and conveying multiple meanings.</p>
		<p>Another philosopher whose work and ideas bear resemblance to this one is W.V.O. Quine, who wrote a book named The Web of Belief. There, Quine's main ideas are centered around beliefs and logic, particularly of a scientific nature, but there is a general, overarching idea which is that beliefs are connected to, informed by, and inform other beliefs, thus forming a web. Furthermore, beliefs that are well-connected to many other beliefs would be more difficult to change, as this would be more cognitively expensive. On the other, beliefs on the “edge” would be easier to change, supplant, or discard entirely as not much is lost and there may even be a gain. The concept-label web is similar in that respect. Concept-labels in the “middle” that are connected to many others are more difficult to alter as doing so would require altering at the very least the associations between it and other concept-labels, and would probably also require at least some adjustment of related concept-labels. For instance, a fundamental, evangelist Christian would probably associate “the Bible” with “infallible”, “Word of God”, “perfect”, and so forth. Hence, when confronted with scientific evidence that contradicts their beliefs and those concept-labels and associations, they are likely to resist because changing such integral beliefs is rather difficult. To accept the claim that the universe is billions of years old, rather than several thousand, would require that “the Bible” be disassociated from “infallible”, which may be as difficult as cutting an iron bar with a pair of scissors. Should such a change be made, though, “the Bible” would also become disassociated from “completely reliable”, a concept-label likely closely associated with “infallible”. On the other hand, if someone saw the word “ubiquitous” once or twice and inferred an incorrect meaning, then they would likely be amenable to correction by another person as that particular concept-label pair isn't particularly crucial to their mental concept-label web. Thus, there is a sort of inertia present in that a concept-label that has been used and confirmed many times and very well-associated with other concept-labels is harder to change, whether it's the concept, label, or relational links being changed.</p>
		<p>In conclusion, the model of concept-label pairs with web-like associations to other concept-label pairs is sufficiently powerful enough to explain many aspects of human language and provide possible explanations for failures of communication. In a way, however, this model also suggests that humans may not be the only ones that have and use language. Currently, some scientists are revealing that some animals definitely have and use language, such as dolphins and elephants, to name a couple. Plus, Koko the gorilla was famously able to learn and use sign language, if only in a rudimentary way, demonstrating that gorillas at least have the ability to use sophisticated language. More recently, the creation of a school for the deaf in Nigeria lead to the spontaneous formation of a new sign language, developed by the deaf students independently of other existing sign languages. Thus, it appears that this model not only explains human spoken language rather well, but also other forms of language employed by humans and animals.</p>

		<p>Concepts can have multiple labels, and multiple concepts can be labeled with the same word. For instance, “happy”, “glad”, and “exuberant” all describe varying degrees of joy, and “run” is a label for multiple concepts, as evidenced by the different meanings in the following phrases: “run a race”, “run for President”, and “my nose is running”.</p>

		<img src="{% static 'starmanite/philosophyPPT/conceptLabelWeb_diagram8.png' %}" alt="concept of a homeless person with positive associations" width="400" height="300" />

On the other hand, if someone saw the word “ubiquitous” once or twice and inferred an incorrect meaning, then they would likely be amenable to correction by another person as that particular concept-label pair isn't particularly crucial to their mental concept-label web.</p>

		<p>Thus, there is a sort of inertia present in that a concept-label that has been used and confirmed many times and very well-associated with other concept-labels is harder to change, whether it's the concept, label, or relational links being changed.</p>
		
		<p>In conclusion, the model of concept-label pairs with web-like associations to other concept-label pairs is sufficiently powerful enough to explain many aspects of human language and provide possible explanations for failures of communication. In a way, however, this model also suggests that humans may not be the only ones that have and use language. Currently, some scientists are revealing that some animals definitely have and use language, such as dolphins and elephants, to name a couple. Plus, Koko the gorilla was famously able to learn and use sign language, if only in a rudimentary way, demonstrating that gorillas at least have the ability to use sophisticated language. More recently, the creation of a school for the deaf in Nigeria lead to the spontaneous formation of a new sign language, developed by the deaf students independently of other existing sign languages. Thus, it appears that this model not only explains human spoken language rather well, but also other forms of language employed by humans and animals.</p>
