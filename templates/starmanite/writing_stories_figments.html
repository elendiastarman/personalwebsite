		<h2>No Longer Figments of the Imagination</h2>
		
		<p><strong>Figments of the imagination? Not anymore.</strong></p>

		<p>Re’gaan, the magnificent city of Orna Arco. It’s buildings were the latest in cutting-edge technology, plated with a chrome-like substance for aesthetic reasons. As such, they shone brightly in the evening sun. Pilots had even given it the name of Beacon City. Four of its skyscrapers were the tallest in the world, reaching two miles into the sky, with five more in the top twenty. Its transportation system had been optimized to the point of absurdity, capable of transporting one from one side of the city to the other -- a distance of more than ten miles -- in only three minutes. Another name for it was Jewel City, on account of its appearance in sunlight as that of a precious stone, and on account of it being the jewel city of the world. However, I could care less about it’s long list of achievements. No, I’m interested in one person, down among the streets. He was in one of the more reputable nightclubs, sitting with his back to the wall. He was merely sitting there with a drink of some kind in his hand, not participating in the dancing. Suddenly, a young woman broke off from the crowd and strode up to him. “Hey Erfohn, come on and join us!” she called out. Without waiting for a reply, she grabbed one of Erfohn’s hands and pulled him to his feet. Quickly, he set his drink down on an adjacent table, having to turn and lean due to the woman still tugging on him, like a reluctant dog on a leash. As his head turned back his eyes swept across the walls. Before he had taken another step, he had frozen. Whipping his head back, he locked his eyes with mine. Jerking his hand out of the woman’s grasp, he shifted his feet to more fully face me.</p>
		<p>“Who are you and how did you get here?” he demanded.</p>
		<p>I was a bit perplexed by how my characters seemed to be interacting.with me. After all, weren’t they figments of my imagination? I put it aside for the moment, chalking it off to the same imagination. Deciding to go along with the flow, I raised my eyebrows, spread my hands, and shrugged.</p>
		<p>The woman, noticing the lack of his presence, came up beside him. Following his gaze, she looked in my direction. She slowly shook her head and then looked at Erfhon somewhat sideways. “What are you talking about?”</p>
		<p>Still staring at me, Erfhon replied, “Enjena, can’t you see him? Right there.”</p>
		<p>Enjena looked back at me and said, “I see him. You’re talking about the guy in the black t-shirt and shorts, deeply tanned skin, reddish-brown hair, middle-twenties, with some sort of arcane technology on his lap?”</p>
		<p>I spoke up, “this on my lap is called a laptop, don’t you know that?”</p>
		<p>At that, they both looked shocked...shocked and amazed. Enjena was the first to recover, “but I thought laptops became obsolete a decade ago! Where have you been? Living under a-”</p>
		<p>Erfhon cut her off, “You still haven’t explained how you came to be sitting near me.”</p>
		<p>Enjena looked at Erfhon with a confused look on her face, “What do you mean?”</p>
		<p>Finally, Erfhon turned to look at her. He explained, “Well, I was sitting there for the past hour. <strong>Nobody</strong> was sitting near me. My eyes were open all the time, I was drinking spring water so I’m not drunk. Then you come over and pull me up and he’s sitting there, not seven feet away!”</p>
		<p>She placed a hand on his shoulder, “I’m sure you saw him enter and simply forgot about him. Look, leave it alone and come dance with me will ya?”</p>
		<p>With a show of reluctance (that surely wasn’t entirely genuine), he consented to her pull. Before he disappeared into the crowd, he paused and shouted back to me, “Don’t go! Talk! Later!”</p>
		<p>I shrugged and shouted, “Alright!”</p>

		<p>Later, as the restaurant was closing, I was sitting in the same place, typing on my keyboard. I looked up and I saw Erfhon walking over to me, albeit in an odd manner. Almost as if I was to be treated with great respect for fear of annihilation. I got my answer soon enough as he stood before me, clearly tense.</p>
		<p>“I’m whispering because all the others think I’m crazy enough already but...” he paused, “...are you God?”</p>
		<p>I looked at him with a bewildered expression on my face, then it dawned on me. “No no no...I’m not God! Not an angel or demon either. I’m just a normal guy.”</p>
		<p>With that, his body loosened, but only a little. He snatched a chair from a side table and sat facing me. He leaned forward, hands on his knees, and murmured in a low voice, “Well then, I don’t think you’re just a normal guy. I was watching where you were sitting after I got pulled into the crowd. You disappeared. Like...poof. One moment you were there, then someone crossed my field of vision and you were gone. I had thought that you had broken your promise. I decided to stay around anyway, just to be sure. Just like the first time, you appeared out of nowhere, sitting in the same place, no less! I checked with the bartender and the doorkeeper, they never saw you come or go. So then...what <em>are</em> you?” As he spoke, a vague explanation began to form in my mind. However, it was so incredulous that my face contorted into a confused expression. Noticing, he asked, “What are you confused about?”</p>
		<p>Half-stuttering, I said, “It’s just that...this whole...situation &ndash; for lack of a better word &ndash; ...is so weird. Lemme think for a moment.”</p>
		<p>He sat back, “Alright.”</p>
		<p>The more I thought about it, the more astonishing and <em>correct</em> it seemed to be. To test my theory, I asked him two questions. “Erfhon...what were you doing before you came to the party?”</p>
		<p>Erfhon’s mouth readily popped open to answer the question, then promptly shut. After a minute, he opened it again, only to utter with confusion, “I don’t remember. Really...I have no memory of anything occurring before the party.”</p>
		<p>I then asked him, “Do you remember what you did between my disappearance and now?”</p>
		<p>Erfhon immediately replied, “I certainly do. I had a great time dancing and socializing, especially with Enjena. After the party was over, I was commissioned to help clean up, as I had nothing to do but wait and nowhere to be but here. Why do you ask?”</p>
		<p>My theory confirmed, I was so astonished that a “My gosh...” slipped from my lips. Mostly to myself, I kept muttering, “I...I created...an entire reality. I just created an entire reality.”</p>
		<p>Erfhon was looking at me quizzically, “Uhhh...what?”</p>
		<p>I looked him straight in the eye and said, “You were a figment of my imagination, as was the party, this building, the city, even the entire world. Yet...not anymore. Somehow, I have created a full blown universe...that continued to exist even when I wasn’t thinking about it or working in it.”</p>
		<p>Erfhon processed this for a few moments, then tentatively mumbled, “So...you’re God?”</p>
		<p>Somewhat amused, a slight smile crept onto my face. “That, is one thing I know I’m not. I may be practically omnipotent in this reality, but in my world, I’m just a regular human male.”</p>
		<p>Erfhon grunted and said, “Wow...this is amazing.”</p>
		<p>“Yes, yes it is.”</p>
		<p>Changing the subject, Erfhon motioned to my computer and asked, “So what are you working on?”</p>
		<p>I shrugged nonchalantly and said, “Just a story I’m working on.”</p>
		<p>“Neat! Can I see it?” He leaned forward.</p>
		<p>In response, I lowered the lid and mildly rebuked him, “No, you may not.” Suddenly, I felt Nature’s call. I looked at Erfhon and apologized, “Sorry, bathroom.” Setting the laptop down on a table next to me, I stood and stretched. When I opened my eyes, I was in for a shock. I was back in my own house, standing in front of my couch in the living room. I had no time to wonder though...I had business to attend to. After I was done, I fixed myself some dinner, namely, a hamburger. What can I say? I live a simple life. After dinner, I lay back on the couch and readied the laptop for a continuation of writing. However, Erfhon was not at the nightclub. Rather, he was sleeping in his own bedroom. He moaned and opened his eyes blearily. After a moment or two, his eyes snapped open and he screamed in surprise, causing me to practically jump off my couch. When I had recovered my wits, he was breathing heavily as a side effect of adrenaline. He had rolled out of bed and was in the process of putting a bathrobe on over his boxer-clad form.</p>
		<p>With a wild look on his face, he practically exclaimed, “WHAT ARE YOU DOING ON MY BED?!?” I was confused for a moment until I realized that I was, in fact, lying on his bed. Muttering apologies, I slid off and sat in a chair next to the wall. As I was shifting, he took a few deep breaths. After a minute or two, apparently he deemed himself calm enough to speak. “Where have you <em>been</em> man?” In response to my unspoken question, he clarified, “It’s been...uhhh...eight days since I saw you last.”</p>
		<p>For me, this was considerably more disturbing. “You mean it’s been a week and a day since I was here? What did you do in that time?”</p>
		<p>His gaze shifted towards the ceiling as he struggled to remember the past several days. “Um...I went to that nightclub several more times...I’ve gotten to know Enjena -- who, by the way, has a wonderful personality -- watched TV, ate...and there’s not really much else of importance. Well, besides expecting you to show up before now.”</p>
		<p>At this, I was severely shaken. I had managed to create a literal universe with a time that was not connected in any way to ours. The ramifications were enormous. I started to give articulation to some as-yet unformed thought, but Erfhon cut me short, “Where’s that lady that was with you the first time?”</p>
		<p>Greatly perplexed, I looked up at him and asked, “What lady? There wasn’t anybody with me the first time. Or any time after that.”</p>
		<p>He mused, “Hmmm...true, she wasn’t there the second time now that I think about it...wait...” At this, his eyes drifted upwards and started making the quick, aimless side-to-side movements typical of a person in deep thought. “Actually, she was there the second time, now that I really think about it. Huh, interesting...I didn’t remember her before.”</p>
		<p>At this, my eyes widened. “Ah, sorry Erfhon, gotta go!” I quickly pushed my laptop off my lap and set it on the floor, stepping away from it. When I raised my eyes, I saw that I was back home, like before. However, there were two differences. For one, I was no longer next to my couch but rather in a chair opposite it. The other one, the object my eyes were fixed on was my girlfriend. In shock, I quickly spewed a question, “Argaen, what are you doing here?”</p>
		<p>She shrugged, “I just came over to visit. In fact, I was just reading your story, it seems very interesting. Very strange too. You wrote as if you were actually interacting with these characters.”</p>
		<p>I must have fairly approximated a fish gasping for air before I came up with something to say. Holding my index finger in the air, I made an excuse, “Ah, one moment, gotta go to the bathroom. Please don’t read any more, will ya?” To be sure, I closed the lid on the laptop.</p>
		<p>“Er, okay. I’ll just sit on the couch then...” floated down the hall after me.</p>
		<p>Slamming the door shut, I sat down on the toilet lid heavily. This was more incredible than I had imagined. Somehow, my girlfriend had entered -- no, invaded, more like -- the universe I had created, even to the point to that she was appearing in the past memories of Erfhon. Memories that should have been permanent and unchangeable if our world was anything to go by. Putting the incomprehensibility of that effect later, I now had a decision to make. Should I show Argaen that this universe was <em>real</em>, or should I hand-wave it and explain it away? After a few minutes of lip-biting deliberation, I made my decision.</p>
		<p>I washed my hands to give the appearance that I had actually gone to the bathroom. I dried them on the towel to the side of the sink and headed down the hall. I stopped at the end of it; I could see Argaen sitting on the couch, facing mostly away. She seemed to be staring off into space. I gazed at her fair, smooth skin, her long, wonderfully brown hair, her slim figure. Shaking my head to jar myself off the track of admiring my beautiful girl, I walked over to her. When she saw me, she stood up and looked into my eyes with her obsidian eyes. I took the plunge, “Argaen, would you like me to show you what I was writing about?” She looked at me askance, perhaps noting my slightly more formal manner. She shrugged and nodded. With that confirmation I stepped over to my laptop and picked it up. She started to get behind me for reading, but I held up a hand to stop her. “I just want to do something real quick.” I added a page break in order to present a blank page to prevent Argaen from reading any more of what I had already written. When I was done, I motioned her to sit beside me on the couch. I set my hands on the keyboard and began typing.</p>
		<p>This time Erfhon wasn’t at the nightclub. Nor was he asleep in bed. This time, we were in the lounge/kitchen combination part of his apartment. We were sitting on a couch about five feet away from a four-person table at which Erfhon was reading some electronic device. He had a doughnut in the other hand and a cup of coffee next to the elbow he had propped on the table, holding up the device. Although he was facing the windows on my side of the room, he immediately froze. I spoke, inwardly wincing at the apologetic tone in my voice, “How long has it been this time?”</p>
		<p>Argaen looked at me somewhat perplexedly, “What do you-”</p>
		<p>I raised a hand to forestall her and waited for Erfhon to reply. His answer was long in coming. “It has been...two years.”</p>
		<p>I winced for real this time. Two whole years. “I’m so sorry. You know I can’t control it. Not really anyway.”</p>
		<p>Argaen spoke up again and this time I let her. “El’endia, what do you mean?”</p>
		<p>By way of reply, I got up and lead her over to the table, at which Erfhon had set down his -- newspaper, I suppose -- and doughnut and was now facing us. “Argaen, this is Erfhon, the first person I met in this world. Erfhon, this is my girlfriend, Argaen. She’s the lady from your first memories, correct?”</p>
		<p>Erfhon nodded, “Yes, that’s the woman I remember.”</p>
		<p>“Now,” I said, “do you remember her after we left the nightclub?”</p>
		<p>This time, he shook his head, “Nope. She wasn’t with you that time you scared the shak out of me.”</p>
		<p>I slowly shook my head. Whether or not someone read this story determined whether or not they experienced this universe, this reality. Curious about the extent of my Author powers, I decided to experiment a little. I looked at Argaen and Erfhon, and declared, “I will make an empty glass appear in my hand. I will then fill it with red wine.” Barely had the words left my mouth when a glass appeared. Immediately after I turned it upside down and back up to demonstrate that it did not have anything in it, it filled to the brim with red wine. Then I said, “I don’t really like wine that much so I’m gonna turn this into water.” Sure enough, no longer was it wine, it was water. I took a sip to moisten my dry mouth, and then offered it to them for them to confirm that it was real, wet, H2O. As Erfhon took a sip, I couldn’t help but notice that Argaen was smirking. When she noticed my eyes on her, she mouthed <em>I see what you did there.</em> I just grinned. After Erfhon was done with it, I drank the rest and crushed it in my hand. When I opened my hand, it was gone.</p>
		<p>Erfhon broke the silence, saying, “So you can do magic tricks. What else?”</p>
		<p>I chuckled, somewhat nervously. “Well...I am going to write something and delete it later. Just to see the effect that has on this world.” I proceeded to do so and then asked Erfhon if he saw anything. He shook his head. I then asked Argaen the same question.</p>
		<p>This time, the response was different. “Yeah, I saw her.”</p>
		<p>To make sure, I asked her, “What was her name?”</p>
		<p>Her gaze was even as she answered, “Enjena.”</p>
		<p>At that, Erfhon started. “What? She was here? My wife was home?” I nodded and directed his gaze to the clock on the wall. His eyes widened and he looked out the windows. “Oh my gosh...three hours have passed.” His eyes snapped back to mine. “Where is she now?”</p>
		<p>“Shopping.” Argaen replied.</p>
		<p>Erfhon sagged in relief. I smiled and lightly slapped his shoulder, saying, “I know how you feel.” I cleared my throat and studiously avoided Argaen’s eyes. “Anyway, this experiment shows that people from our universe have memories that are unaltered by what I write, while that is not necessarily true for ‘in-universe’ people, like you.” At that, I motioned to Erfhon. “In fact, I’ll bet that if you ask Enjena when she gets home, she won’t have any memory of coming home and going shopping. That was what I wrote and deleted.” Looking at their faces, I sensed that they hadn’t quite realized the full import of the situation. “Guys, think about it! This universe is a full functioning universe, but anybody from my world has incredible -- nay, unlimited -- power in this reality. Imagine the chaos that would erupt if some unscrupulous person, well, really anybody who had no idea that this is real, gained access and started reading, writing, or even deleting?” I saw comprehension dawning on their faces and decided to drive the point home anyway. “My friends, this is dangerous, even deadly power I hold in my hand.”</p>
		<p>After a brief silence, Argaen spoke, “That’s not good.”</p>
		<p>The extremeness of the understatement caused me to quickly empty in one explosive gust, making a <em>pffft</em> sound. I chuckled half-heartedly, “No, it’s not. I have to protect this story somehow, keep it from ending up in other people’s hands.”</p>
		<p>Erfhon, with great hesitation, suggested, “Why not just delete it?”</p>
		<p>I turned to him, facial expression of one gently pointing out a grave misunderstanding, “Well, no, I can’t just delete it. This entire reality &ndash; and I stress reality &ndash; is sustained by this story. If I delete it, that is tantamount to killing everyone and obliterating this world and the universe!”</p>
		<p>At that moment, the door opened and Enjena walked in. She stopped short of closing for a moment, taken aback by the presence of two other people in the room. Erfhon, mindful of what had happened earlier, introduced us to Enjena. She looked at us, and then recognition dawned on her face. “Oh yeah, you were the one that had the laptop, which I see you’re still holding, and you were the one sitting next to him, all those years ago.”</p>
		<p>“Yes, ma’am, that is correct. Now, if you don’t mind, I’ll ask you a question.” I replied.</p>
		<p>She shook her head, “Not at all. Fire away.”</p>
		<p>“Alright,” I sighed, “How did you get to the mall?”</p>
		<p>She drew in breath in preparation for a quick answer, and paused that way for several seconds. Finally, she let her breath out and appeared to be thinking furiously. After a minute or so, she spoke up at last, “How very odd. I have absolutely no memory of getting to the mall.”</p>
		<p>“But you do remember before that.” I continued.</p>
		<p>She confirmed my guess, “Yes, I do. How weird, one moment, at work. The next, at the mall.” I pursed my lips, nodded, and threw significant looks at Argaen and Erfhon. Enjena, bewildered as to what was going on, implored of her husband, “Erfhon, is that what you were talking about just now?”</p>
		<p>Erfhon started to reply, but I cut him short with a swift jab in the ribs. Ignoring his glare, I answered, “You need not worry about it. It was unimportant. <em>Right</em> Erfhon?” Erfhon, after shooting me a murderous glance, nodded. Enjena looked at us suspiciously, but acquiesced. Inwardly, I sighed in relief. Looking around at present company, I decided that there was nothing further to be accomplished. Accordingly, I began making farewells, “Sorry to cut this visit short, but we’ve intruded on your hospitality too long. we’ll be back tomorrow.”</p>
		<p>Erfhon’s eyebrows knitted together, “How do you know you’ll be-” Seeing my raised eyebrow, he amended, “Um, I mean, are you sure?”</p>
		<p>Smiling, I nodded and said, “Remember the nightclub?” With that, I turned and headed over to the door, laptop in arm, and pulled it open. We all made our final farewells to each other and Argaen and I stepped out into the hallway outside the door, pulling it closed. I popped the last bit of doughnut in my mouth and shot Argaen a satisfied look. She just stared at me incredulously. We heard an exclamation from inside along the lines of <em>my doughnut!</em> and I quickly closed the lid on the laptop to take us back to our world.</p>
		<p>Argaen looked at me with amusement, “You filched his doughnut?”</p>
		<p>My only response was to roll my eyes towards the ceiling and shrug, feigning ignorance. Sobering, I swallowed the last of the doughnut and set the laptop on the floor. I looked at Argaen with an anguished look on my face, “What am I supposed to do about this? I can’t delete it, because I’ll destroy that reality. I can’t simply hide the file or the laptop since someone might stumble upon it, and proceed to destroy the reality anyway. Yet, I can’t simply do nothing. Argaen, the fate of an entire universe rests in my hands! What am I going to do?!?”</p>
		<p>Argaen looked about to cry, but she didn’t, for which I was glad. Instead, she took my hand and assured me, “El’endia, milk, I know you’ll make the right decision.”</p>
		<p>I took a deep breath, nodded, and then looked her in the eye. I swallowed a few times to clear my throat, and said, “Thank you honey. Um...can you come back over like...10:00 AM tomorrow? I’m going back tomorrow, and I want you to be with me.”</p>
		<p>Argaen nodded. After a few seconds, we both realized there was nothing more to say. Thus, Argaen kissed me on the cheek, bidding her customary <em>good night</em> as she left. I stood there for a few moments longer, reveling in the memory of her presence. Shaking myself from my reverie, I took precautions on my laptop, such as encrypting the document, to ensure that no one would accidentally or purposefully stumble upon it. I then went to bed.</p>
		<p>I barely slept that night. The dilemma kept slamming around in my head. For hours I weighed the two evils. For hours I searched desperately for a third option. I turned over and over, never feeling comfortable. I alternated between being too hot and too cold. In short, it was a terrible night. Considering the wretched situation I was in, it was a fitting night. Finally, at fourteen minutes after three in the morning, I at last, found a solution. For the next half hour, I applied my brain relentlessly to finding possible flaws in the solution. Eventually, satisfied I had found a bullet-proof solution to my despicable problem, I fell asleep.</p>
		<p>I woke up in the morning, the disharmonious buzzing of the alarm clock rattling my eardrums. With a grunt, I reached over and hit the <em>off</em> button. As I sat up and rubbed my eyes, the events of the night before came back to me. For a moment, I wondered if it was a dream. That thought was soon dispelled by the doorbell. I quickly looked at the time on the alarm clock. It read 9:50. “Shoot!” I exclaimed. Gone was the fuzziness that comes after waking up from a deep sleep; I was fully awake. Awake, and eager to see Argaen. I jumped out of bed -- almost literally -- and threw on some clothes. Then I hurried to my door to let my girlfriend in. I was practically bursting with excitement, it was all she could do to get me to eat at least a token breakfast. As such, it was 10:10 when I finally headed to the safe I had for important documents; the safe that was now holding my laptop. Another five minutes and I had all of the security measures deactivated and my fingers on the keyboard. Like before, Argaen and I sat side by side on the couch.</p>
		<p>Immediately, we were back in Erfhon and Enjena’s apartment, sitting on their couch like before. Just in time, it seemed, for the door to the bedroom across us opened and Erfhon came out. He stopped, just like every other time, but this time, he had an expression that seemed to be one of pleasant surprise.</p>
		<p>“Hey man, where you been? It’s been twenty-nine years...” he walked towards me with his arms open. When I cocked my head sideways, he stopped and chuckled. Apparently, I had actually been right; it was only the next day. It wasn’t even afternoon yet. I directed him to call Enjena, which he did. The three of them stood facing me as I related my plan to them.</p>
		<p>“Alright,” I cleared my throat, “here’s what I’m going to do. I will make a few copies of the document, probably three or four. Then I will heavily encrypt them with several applications of practically unbreakable encryption methods. After that, I’ll split each copy up into ten or so pieces, distribute them among flash drives and bury each of them in remote, far flung areas. The dispersal part will serve to ensure that if someone <em>does</em> find one <strong>and</strong> decrypt it, a highly implausible occurrence, that they will not be able to, in any practical sense, find the rest and reconstruct it back into a whole. The duplication is important because I think the existence of this reality depends on all of the data being present, not necessarily as a unified whole. Thus, if one part gets destroyed, hopefully an extremely rare occurrence, there will still be other parts that contribute enough to form a unified whole among all of them. Well...whaddya think?”</p>
		<p>From the expressions on their faces, it seemed to me that they were all ready to bow down and worship me for my awesome problem-solving skills. Well...maybe they were just a little awed. If that. Finally, after a long silence, Erfhon spoke up, “Well, I can’t think of a better plan. Sounds pretty reasonable.”</p>
		<p>Enjena put in her two cents and said, “This entire scheme is mostly dependent on the assumption that this world will stay in existence after fragmentation, but I see no better option, so go ahead!”</p>
		<p>“Actually, Enjena,” I put in, “computers deal all the time with fragmentation in programs and in data. So, if it can work for that, it should work for this.”</p>
		<p>Argaen was last to offer her opinion. “Alright. Sounds good. Let’s get on with it!”</p>
		<p>As we knew we would not be seeing the other pair again, our goodbyes definitely had a ring of finality to them. With much crying on the part of the women, we parted ways. I immediately set about executing my plan. An hour later, it was done. All that remained was to delete the original and set out to bury the flash drives in hard-to-reach places. I was sitting there in front of the computer, the file selected, the finger resting on the [DEL] button. I felt a hand on my shoulder. I looked up at Argaen for a moment, and said, “This is it. Once I delete this original, there’s no going back.”</p>
		<p>She squeezed my shoulder for reassurance. “El’endia, what’s done is done. You’ve made your plan, you’ve executed most of it. Now, let’s finish it, you and I, together.”</p>
		<p>At that, I smiled. Without looking, I pushed down. With that, it was done.</p>
		<p>For the next few years, Argaen and I traveled all over the world, sowing the flash drives -- encased in nearly indestructible cases -- in places such as the bottom of the great Amazon River, under the sweltering sands of the Sahara Desert, at the bottom of the deep Mariana Trench, down one of the inaccessible crevasses in the Himalayas, and other places around the world. As we traveled, we posed as tourists -- and we were -- so that no one could get a whiff of our true purpose. All that time spent together drew us closer like never before. Consequently, upon coming back home for the first time in years, I lead her to the couch where we had sat so long ago. There, I took a knee and asked her to marry me. Eighty years later, we were both in our hundreds. We had three children, seven grandchildren, eleven great-grandchildren, and even a great-great-grandchild! At one gigantic family reunion, we were just sitting off to the side, enjoying each other’s company. All of a sudden, I sensed that someone had been standing next to me for some time. I slowly turned and looked at the middle-aged gentleman beside me. It took me several seconds, but I finally recognized the man, I croaked out “Erfhon...is that...you?”</p>
		<p>Behind me, I heard a similar query from the love of my life, “Enjena?”</p>
		<p>At my look of confusion, Erfhon said, “Remember that doughnut that you stole? Well, it passed from my world to yours. In a similar way, I’ve come to take you Home.”</p>
		<p>When I heard <em>Home</em>, my heart leaped for joy. A gasp from behind me told me that she had also felt the longing. I twisted away and looked at Argaen, eyes bright and cracked lips spread wide. “<em>Home.</em>” I repeated. She nodded enthusiastically. “Erfhon, take us Home!”</p>
		<p>Smiling, they helped us out of our chairs and we started walking. A curious transformation began to take place. The rest of the world faded away and a path of gold -- pure, whitish translucent gold -- appeared before us. In addition, our bodies changed too, becoming more youthful.
